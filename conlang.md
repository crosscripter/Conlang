# Conlang
An easy-to-learn, diverse sounding and poetic personal language.
In conlang a person takes a source language, say English, and systematically maps each letter
in the source word to an equivalent conlang letter thereby creating a new conlang word.
Simple syllabification, grammatical, and spelling rules and exceptions are put in place to maintain a specific ancient and exotic sound to the language:

## Letter Mapping
In conlang each letter in English whether consonant or vowel has an equivalent conlang letter.  
Below a table of consonant and vowel mappings are shown:

### Vowels
All common vowels are pronounced as most other foreign languages except for English.However, vowel sounds in conlang differ depending on gender:

For example:
* Female speakers will pronounce all vowels short
* Male speakers will pronounce all vowel long 
* When speaking to the opposite gender, the speaker will use the recipients vowel system:
    * a man speaking to a woman will use short vowels when speaking to her
    * a woman speaking to a man will use long vowels when speaking to him.
    * When the recipient is unknown, the common vowels are used shown in the table below:

|English |Conlang| Male/Common Sound        | Female Sound          |
|--------|-------|--------------------------|------------------------
| A      | I     | **ee** in *f**ee**t*     | **i** in *h**it**t*   |
| E      | O     | **o** in *g**o***        | **o** in _**o**ffice_ |
| I      | A     | **a** in *f**a**ther*    | **a** in _**a**pple_  |
| O      | E     | **ay** in _s**ay**_      | **e** in _b**e**d_    |
| U      | Ey    | **ay** in *d**ay***      | **e** in _f**e**d_    |
| -EE-*  | U     | **oo** in *b**oo**t*     | **u** in _c**u**t_    |

_NOTE: **-EE-** is a special rule discussed later, suffice to say when two English **E**s are found together they become a **U** instead of two equivalent **O**s (**OO** => **U**)_

### Consonants
Each English consonant is replaced by the equivalent conlang consonant.
A couple of exceptions to note are:

* The letter is N does not change, it is equivalent to itself.
* The letters **C**, **Q**, and **X** which all have a **K**-like sound are replaced with a **K** and are translated all the same.
* The conlang letter **Ts** is pronounced like both a **T** sound, immediately followed by an **S** sound, like the **zz** in _pi**zz**a_ or the **ts** in _slit**ts**_.
* The conlang letter **R** is pronounced like the Spanish **rr**, trilled with the throat.
* The conlang letter **K** is pronounced like a *hard K* as in the **ch** in the German word _Ba**ch**_
* The conlang letter **'H** is pronounced like a *hard H*, as if pushing harder when pronouncing H, aspirating more.
* There is no equivalent **B** sound in the conlang language_

## Translation

### Syllabification
Syllables in conlang are of the CCV, CV or VC form, meaning you can have one or two consonants, followed by a single vowel OR you can have one vowel followed by one or two consonants.  Double consontants such as **Ts** and **Sh** count for only on consonant slot, in other words two consonants could be **Sh**+**R** or **G**+**V**:

Each syllable is formed by following this rule starting at the beginning of the conlang word until the end.  

If a word ends in a C(C)V or VC(C) then the word ends in a closed syllable, however, sometimes during translation a word with end with two consonants, when this is the case then the following syllabification exceptions are applied:

#### Legal Prefix/Suffix Consonant Pairs
* **Sh**
* **Ts** 
* *C* + **L** , **R**
* **S** + **M** , ...
* *Any other pair that is easily pronounced*

_Any pair that is not listed above is deemed an *illegal consonant pair* and is subject to the special rules listed below._

### Pronounciation
All consonant pairs are pronounced by beginning with the first consonant's sound and morphing into the final consonants sound by the end.  Some sounds this easier to do than others, for example, **G**+**L** is easier than **G**+**V** or **SH**+**R**+**V**. No triple consonant pair should be pronounced together but as the *Triple Consonant Pair* rule below states, an intervening **A** vowel is added between the 2nd and the 3rd consonant, such that **SH**+**R**+**V** becomes **SH**+**R**(A)**V** instead:
                         
#### Dangling Consonant Rule
The *Dangling Consonant* rule applies when a translated word ends with an illegal
combination of two consonants.  In this case, a final **A** is added to round out
the sound of the word:

For example:

    English     "Desk" => D + E + S + K
    Conlang               T + O + M + L + -A => "Tomla"
    NOT                   T + O + M + -A- + L => "Tomal"


#### Ending -S Rule
The one exception to the *Dangling Consonant* rule is that if the ending letter is an **S** then the final **A** is added BEFORE the final consonant, in between the first and second letters of the pair:

For example:

    English     "Waters" => W + A + T +  E + R + S
    Conlang                H' + I + Sh + O + V + -A- + M => "'Hishovam"
    NOT                    H' + I + Sh + O + V + M + -A => "'Hishovma"

However, if the ending **S** is ALSO a double letter then the *Double Letter Rule* below takes precedence:

    English:   "Grass" => G + R + A + S + S
    Conlang               D + V + I + (SS => M) => "Dvim"
    NOT                   D + V + I + M + -A- M => "Dvimam"

#### Double Letter Rule
If in an english word there is a double of a given consonant, then the second of the same
letter double is dropped during translation.

For example:

    English     "Battle" => B + A + T + T      + L + E
    Conlang                 Y + I + (TT => Sh) + K + -A => "Yishka"
    NOT                     Y + I + Sh + Sh    + K + -A => "yishshka"
    
    English     "Pill" => P + I + L + L
    Conlang               G + A + (LL => K) => "Gak"
    NOT                   G + A + (LL => K) + -A => "Gaka"

    BUT

    English     "Pile" => P + I + L + E
    Conlang               G + A + K + -A =>  "Gaka"

#### Triple Consonant Rule
However, if instead the word contains a triple consonant combination AND the last two consonant pair is an illegal consonant pair in which the *Dangling Consonant* rule would apply. Then an infixed **A** is inserted between the 2nd and 3rd consonants of the triplet:

For example:

    English     "Light" => L + I + G + H + T
    Conlang                K + A + D + R + -A- + Sh => "Kadrash"
    NOT                    K + A + D + R + Sh + -A => "Kadrsha"

#### Double -EE- Rule
When an English word contains a doubled e or two **E**s in a row in the word, such as in the word _f**ee**t_, the equivalent letter **O**s would be translated to **OO** which both collapse into a **U** letter sound.

For example:

    English     "Feet" => F  + -E + E-       + T
    Conlang               Ts + (E + E => U) + Sh => "Tsush"
    NOT                   Ts +  O + O       + Sh +> "Tsoosh"

#### Final -E Rule
When an English word ends in a final **E**, which is equivalent to **O** usually,
it is translated as an ending **A** instead:

    English     "Dove" => D + O + V +  -E
    Conlang               T + E + F + (-E => A) => "Tefah"
    NOT                   T + E + F +   O => "Tefo"

But when a word meets both the *Double and Final E* rules the *Double E* rule
takes precendence:

For example:

    English     "See" => S + -E + -E- 
    Conlang              M + (-E + E- => U) => "Mu"    
    NOT                  M + (-(-E + -E- => U) => A => "Mua"
    NOT                  M + O + (-E => A) => "Moa"

### Stress 
The stress will ALWAYS fall on the last syllable of one, two or three syllable words.
However at four syllables the word is divided into two syllable word pairs and a secondary stress is placed on the 2nd syllable and main stress on the last syllable.

For example:

**One syllable**

Single syllable is stressed:

    English     "Cat" => C + A + T
    Conlang              L + I + Sh => "Lish" 
pronounced (**LEESH**)


**Two syllable**

Last syllable is stressed:

    English     "Dark" => D + A + R + K
    Conlang               T + I + V + L -A => "Tivla"
pronounced (teev•**LAH**)


**Three syllable**

Last syllable is stressed:

    English     "Stress" => S + T        + R + E + S + S
    Conlang                 M + Sh + -A- + V + O + (SS => M) + -A => "Mshavoma"
pronounced (m'shah•voh•**MAH**)

**Four or More**
Split word into longest equal syllable pairs, (ie. 2 + 2 or 2 + 3 etc.) with the longest pair being the last and place stress on last syllable of each of the syllable pairs:

    "Darkness" => "Tivlanoma"

2 + 2 construct

pronounced (teev•**lah** + noh•**MAH**)

    "transportation" => "Shvinmagevshishaen"

3 + 3 construct

pronounced (shveen•mah•**gehv** + shee•shah•**AYN**)

    "antigravitational" => "Inshadvifashishaenik"

2 + 3 + 3 construct!

pronounced (een•**shahd** + vee•fah•**shee** + shah•ay•**NEEKH**)


### Writing System/Transliteration
Conlang can be written using both the Latin or Hebrew alphabets.
The following table shows how to transliterate into the Hebrew alphabet:

|English |Conlang |Hebrew | Final  |
|--------|--------|-------|---------
| B      | Y      | י     |
| D      | T      | ת     |
| F      | Ts     | צ  | ץ|      
| G      | D      | ד     |
| H      | R      | ר     |
| J      | S      | ס     | 
| K      | L      | ל     |
| L      | K      | ק     |
| M      | Z      | ז     |
| N      | N      | נ | ן|       
| P      | G      | ג     | 
| R      | V      | ב     |
| S      | M      | מ  | ם|     
| T      | Sh     | ש     |
| V      | F      | פ  | ף|     
| W      | 'H     | ח     |
| Y      | '      | ע     |
| Z      | H      | ה     |

_NOTE: Keep in mind Hebrew is written from *right-to-left*:_

For example:

    English     "Feet" => F  + -E + E-       + T
    Conlang               Ts + (E + E => U) + Sh => "Tsush"
    Hebrew                צ + ו + ש = צוש

    English     "Dove" => D + O + V +  -E
    Conlang               T + E + F + (-E => A) => "Tefah"
    Hebrew                ת + פ + ה = תפה

    English     "See" => S + -E + -E- 
    Conlang              M + (-E + E- => U) => "Mu"    
    Hebrew               מ + ו + א = מוא


## Examples of Translation
Let's take a common phrase used in conlag translations, it comes from the book of Genesis, chapter 11 from the Bible.  It is, fitingly enough, about languages after all.  It will server to show how different sounds can show up in conlang:

**English**:
## _"Now the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.."._

**Conlang**:
## _"Neh shra 'hreka oivshar 'him ets ena kindeyida int ets ena mgulra..."_
## נך שרא חרקא ויבשר חם אץ אנא קינדידא אנת אץ מגלרה
(naykh shrah 'hray•**KHAH** weev•**SHAR** 'heem ets eh•**NAH** keen•**day**•yee•**DAH** eent ets eh•**NAH** mgool•**RAH**)


    "Now" => N + O + W 
             N + E + H' => "Neh'"    
    
    "the" => T  + H + E 
             Sh + R + (-E => -A) => "shra"
    
    "whole" => W + H + O + L + E
              H' + R + E + K + (-E => -A) => "h'reka"
    
    "earth" => E + A + R + T + H 
               O + I + V + Sh + -A- + R => "oivshar"
    
    "was" => W + A + S
            H' + I + M => "h'im"

    "of" => O + F
            E + Ts => "ets"

    "one" => O + N + E
             E + N + (-E => -A) => "ena"

    "language" => L + A + N + G + U  + A + G + E
                  K + I + N + D + EY + I + D + (-E => -A) => "kindeyida"
    
    "and" => A + N + D
             I + N + T => "int"

    "speech" => S + P + E + E       + C + H
                M + G + (-EE- => U) + L + R + -A => "mgulra"
